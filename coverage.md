## Measuring WLAN Performance: Ruckus Goes Open Source ##
A step towards a tool that really measures wireless performance

As you probably know, I spend a lot of time benchmarking and otherwise testing wireless LAN systems. This is a tricky business; I've written widely on the topic, and the bottom line here is that it is very challenging in a freespace environment to definitively compare two different systems. We can of course use the same benchmark tools and traffic/load parameters in each case; the process here is essentially identical to what we'd do in the case of wire. But wireless introduces two additional variables over which one doing the testing has no control...
